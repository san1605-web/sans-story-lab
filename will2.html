    <h1>Will You Be the Wonder</h1>
    <div class="chapter">Vol 2 — Sean</div>

    <p>
      Sean got the book from Clara, and the moment he opened it, he realised something strange—he was in the story, playing a character with the exact same name as him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this Sean was nothing like the real one. This version hated books, hated studying, and even tore books apart just to play with them. It made the real Sean furious.


    </p>

    <p>
      He understood, though, why the story’s Sean had turned out that way. In the past, that Sean had been a good student, though often left out. When his grades finally dropped, he convinced himself that people only wanted to talk to him because of his academic success. So, he stopped doing what they wanted and started doing only what he pleased. Misled by his so-called friends, he became terrible at everything.


    </p>

    <p>
      The real Sean knew he had to change this other Sean—create a wonder—so the book could be passed to his father.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Sean opened his eyes, he was back on the very day his friends had made fun of him. Somehow, he ended up crying. 
    </p>

    <p>
      They joked about him, saying he never wanted to talk or listen during discussions.
      That made Sean so angry he told them,
      <em>“Stop the discussion.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once…
    </p>

    <p>
      Twice…
    </p>

    <p>
      Thrice…
    </p>

    <p>
      Then Sean shouted.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of his so-called friends snapped,
      <em>“Why are you shouting? Are you mad?”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Others looked on but stayed silent.
      The same friend added,
      <em>“He’s always like that—when he doesn’t understand or isn’t capable of getting it, he blames others.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sean’s anger flared. But instead of lashing out, he stormed off,
      forcing himself to stay in control so they wouldn’t get hurt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as he turned the corner, he saw something that made his blood run cold—
      his own father standing there… inside the story.
    </p>

    <p>
      On seeing that illusion, the real Sean woke up with a jolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      From that moment, he decided he would never tolerate such bullies again.
      He immediately cut ties with them, went home, and began preparing for the exam that was only two days away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Days passed, and Sean was doing well.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that time, he realised something important—he wanted to be a teacher.
      Not just any teacher, but someone who could help students like him—
      those who had been misled or bullied—by being their emotional support and mental strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this new dream in mind, he worked harder than ever.
      He chose his favourite subject, one that would let him spend long hours in the library.
      In the end, Sean decided to become a history teacher.
    </p>
<p>He stopped wasting time and began exploring different hobbies, eventually excelling in some of them. But he didn’t know how to express himself, and he was too tired of explaining, so he chose not to speak.</p>
    <p>
      Years passed.
    </p>
<p>He kept working toward his dream lifestyle.</p>
    <p>
      When he finally achieved it, Sean left the country—far from everything, far from his past.
      A new Sean, and now a teacher for students like the one he once was.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this new place, he found a way to express himself. There was no one who knew him, and no one he knew. He happily went to school, ready for his first day—only to find a group of students in class sleeping. History was not something they were interested in.
    </p>
    <p>So he thought of a way.</p>
    <p>
“Hi guys, let’s introduce ourselves. Myself Sean, and I’m your history teacher—you all know that. One more thing I want to say is… for the next two weeks, your games period is going to be mine.”</p>
<p>The students’ faces fell in disappointment.</p>
<p>Seeing their reactions, Sean laughed.

</p>
<p>The students were confused, but after a while they were relieved to see that he was just like one of them—joyful and adventurous.

</p>
<p>Sean then asked the students to introduce themselves.</p>



<p>“Myself Valery—I want my future job to be creative.”</p>

<p>“Myself Willa—I want mine to be creative too, but let me take it at my own pace.”</p>

<p>“Myself Wilmar—I want something with a high salary.”
</p>
<p>“Myself Wonka—I want something different, where I can rule.”</p>



<p>The time ended, but the students walked away inspired, because Sean had listened to them patiently and answered with care.</p>



<p>Sean ended the class with a smile and a warm, “Goodbye. Tomorrow, we’ll do something more interesting.”</p>



<p>That night, Sean didn’t rest at all. He spent the whole night planning the next day’s class, designing games for the students—games that would help them open up, share their thoughts, and see history in a way they never had before.</p>



<p>The next day, Sean arrived with his laptop and a bag full of props. On the way to school, he grew irritated—some people gave him odd, almost mocking looks because of the props, even though he was in his own car. He nearly wanted to throw a punch when someone asked, *“What are those?”* (Book-lover Sean couldn’t stand having to explain things 😂).</p>



<p>Upon arrival, he was excited to see the students.</p>

<p>Time crawled by as he checked his watch almost every minute, waiting for his class.</p>
<p>Finally—his class time.</p>
<p>He walked in carrying the props and laptop. A few students who were hanging out in the corridor saw him and came to help bring everything inside… though one of them tried to sneak into the class just to sleep. Sean caught it, smiled, and together they got everyone inside.
</p>


<p>The students watched him with growing excitement.</p>

<p>Then he said, “I still see some of you aren’t interested. And I spent *all night* doing this stuff. I’m really disappointed. Bye, guys…”</p>



<p>The students froze, unsure if he was serious. A few exchanged nervous glances, while others sat up straighter, wondering what they’d done wrong.</p>



<p>Sean picked up his laptop bag, turned toward the door, and began walking out slowly.
</p>


<p>“Wait, sir!” one of them blurted.</p>

<p>Another added, “We… we want to see what you’ve brought.”</p>



<p>Sean stopped, turned halfway, and gave them a sly grin.</p>

<p>“Ah, so *now* you’re interested.”</p>



<p>He walked back to the front, set down the props, and said, “Good. Because today’s lesson isn’t just history—it’s a game.”</p>



<p>He explained the rules and sent them all their copies so they could play. When it was time for PE class, the students went to Mr. Dan, their PE teacher, and voluntarily asked him for leave so they could stay in Sean’s history class. Seeing their excitement, Mr. Dan agreed.</p>



<p>By the end of the day, each student received a small gift for winning, and Sean had learned each one’s personality and attitude. He had become their favourite teacher—or rather, their best friend.</p>



<p>Even Sean couldn’t believe it himself. As he turned to wave goodbye to the children, he remembered how he was once a child who had no friends to say goodbye to at school. Now, he had turned himself into a wonder… and changed the other Sean too.</p>



…



<p>He woke up. Clara was gone. Panic rushed through him as he went to search for her.</p>



<p>Relief washed over him when he found her sleeping peacefully in her bed. Quietly, he left the room and went to hand over the story to his father—who was already waiting for Vol 2, and for what was to come in Vol 3.</p>
