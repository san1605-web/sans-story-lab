    <h1>Will You Be the Wonder</h1>
    <div class="author">By San</div>

    <div class="intro">
      Some people live in the world.<br>
      Others live in a thousand worlds hidden in pages.<br><br>
      But sometimes… the pages open,<br>
      and the world lets them in.
    </div>

    <h2>Chapter 1 — The Family of Books</h2>

    <p>
      In the quiet village of <strong>Swavol</strong> lived a peculiar family.
    </p>

    <p>
      They did not blend easily with the outside world, but within the walls of their home, they lived in perfect harmony—with books.
    </p>

    <p>
      People called them strange, but anyone who truly understood them knew they carried entire worlds inside their minds.
      They could talk for hours about the things they read—often so long that others grew bored.
      But for them, these conversations were treasures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among them was Sean, a boy whose entire being was wrapped in words and pages.
      He spent his time pursuing unusual hobbies, finding unique ways to stay unique.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their house was a haven for any book lover: towering shelves crammed with novels,
      the scent of paper and ink lingering in the air, soft cushions scattered around like clouds waiting to be sunk into.
      It had the timeless, moody charm of dark academia, where the only sound was the turning of a page.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 2 — The Night of 11:11</h2>

    <p>
      One quiet night, Sean was curled into a cushion, an apple in one hand and a book in the other.
      The title read: <em>Will You Be the Wonder?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      He read so deeply that he began to feel the story around him.
      His sister sat nearby, reading another volume of the same book.
      His parents were there too, each lost in their own chapters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The room was silent except for the rustle of pages, the soft breath of wind,
      and the silver touch of moonlight. It felt like a dream.
    </p>

    <p>
      The clock struck <strong>11:11</strong>.
      They looked up from their pages, the thought striking them all at once—
      <em>What if we could be inside the book?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      And then… the dream became real.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 3 — Inside the Story</h2>

    <p>
      When they woke again, they were in unfamiliar surroundings.
      The neighbors looked different—no, not different.
      The <em>world</em> was different.
    </p>

    <p>
      They realized, with a strange thrill, that they had each fallen into a separate volume.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sean was in Volume Two, his sister Clara in Volume One,
      their father in Volume Three, and their mother in Volume Four.
    </p>

    <p>
      To pass the story along, each would need to live their part before giving the next volume to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was Clara’s turn first.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 4 — Clara Becomes Dia</h2>

    <p>
      Clara found herself as <em>Dia</em>, her character in Volume One—
      a girl a little like her, but quieter, more hesitant.
    </p>

    <p>
      She remembered this part of the story.
      Dia’s so-called friends had left her stranded, driving away without her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Clara wasn’t going to let the scene play out as written.
    </p>

    <p><em>“Keys.”</em></p>

    <p>
      They ignored her. She asked again—still nothing.
      On the third attempt, Lara muttered, <em>“So petty.”</em>
    </p>

    <p><em>“Keys.”</em></p>

    <p>
      Lara scoffed. <em>“Why don’t you just walk?
      Better one person suffers than all of us, right?”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“I asked for the keys, not your advice.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Clara snatched the keys and drove away.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 5 — Changing the Story</h2>

    <p>
      This time, she refused to stay silent.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“They weren’t good to me,”</em> she said later,
      <em>“so I didn’t need to be good to them.”</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 6 — The Wonder Appears</h2>

    <p>
      Dia did not fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      She stood tall, marks in hand, while those who expected her to break looked on in disbelief.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the first time, they saw her clearly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brighter. Stronger.
      A wonder.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 7 — Passing the Volume</h2>

    <p>
      Dia was a wonder created by Clara.
    </p>

    <p>
      And perhaps… Clara had always been the wonder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sean was still waiting for his turn in Volume Two.
    </p>

      And some… are rewritten<br>
