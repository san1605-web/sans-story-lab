    <p>
      A Story of Friendship, Mistakes, and Finding Your Own Way Once upon a time in a peaceful forest, all animals lived together in harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among them were two very different groups—a colony of ants and a herd of elephants.


    </p>

    <p>
      As winter approached, the ant colony had to gather food to survive the harsh season.

    </p>

    <p>
      The Ant King called a meeting.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      “My dear citizens and brave soldiers,” he began, “we need a faster way to collect food. Time is short. Anyone with a good idea will be rewarded.” </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ant General stepped forward.</p>
      <p><em> “Oh mighty Highness,” </em>he said,<em> “I have a plan!” </em></p><p><em>“That’s my general!”</em> the King said proudly.</p><p><em> “Speak!”</em></p>
      <p><em> “What if... we start swimming classes?”</em> said the General.</p><p> The King was furious.</p><p><em> “Swimming?! It’s winter, not the rainy season!” </em></p><p>But the General explained,<em> “I meant we could offer swimming lessons to other animals in exchange for food. That way, we collect food while they learn something useful.” </em></p><p>The King calmed down and liked the idea.<em> “But who will teach swimming?”</em></p><p><em> “I’ll train our soldiers first,” </em>the General said, <em>“then they can teach others.”</em></p><p> The Ant Queen suggested,<em> “Let’s make pamphlets and paste them on tree barks. That way, all animals will know!”</em>,/p><p> The King approved and handed out the posters.</p><p>.......</p><p> Soon, Ant Swimming School was officially open!</p><p> Days passed...</p><p> Many small animals enrolled, learned to swim, and paid with fruits and nuts. </p><p>Everything was going smoothly—until the elephants joined.,/p><p> Everyone in the elephant team learned quickly—except <b>Jumbo</b>,<em> the lazy one. </em></p>He was mocked by others and felt ashamed.</p><p> One day, while walking sadly through the woods, Jumbo tripped on a tree bark.</p><p> It was the ant’s poster! </p><p>Inspired, he gathered lots of food as fees and set out to join the classes.</p><p> But... Jumbo got lost.</p><p> After wandering for a while, he finally found the place and shouted excitedly for a tutor.</p><p> Unfortunately, he didn’t notice the General under his foot!<em> “Ouch! Get off me!”</em> shouted the General, but Jumbo couldn’t hear him. </p><p>The ant army arrived and poked his foot, and Jumbo quickly realized what had happened.</p><p><em> “I’m so sorry!” </em>he said, embarrassed.</p><p> Despite being injured, the General saw all the food Jumbo brought and decided to teach him. He climbed Jumbo’s trunk to give instructions—but Jumbo sneezed, flinging the General into the air!</p><p> The Ant King rushed in.</p><p> He ordered the General be taken to the medic and decided to teach Jumbo himself. But climbing Jumbo wasn’t easy. The King got hurt too. Finally, with the army's help, he climbed up and they headed to a nearby river. On the way, the King asked,<em> “Jumbo, bring me some leaves!” </em>Jumbo shook an entire tree, injuring the King again.</p><p><em> “You fool! Do you think I need a whole tree to swim?!”</em> Jumbo, remembering the insult, picked two leaves.</p><p><em> “Act your size!”</em> yelled the King.So Jumbo brought two branches instead.</p><p> At the river, the King dove in first.</p><p> Then he yelled,<em> “Jumbo, JUMP!”</em> Forgetting Jumbo’s size, the King didn’t look back.</p><p> Jumbo jumped—and accidentally crushed the King. </p><p>The Queen, hearing the news, was devastated. In her rage, she ordered the soldiers:<em> “Find Jumbo and throw him into the sea!” </em></p><p>They did.</p><p> Panicked and terrified, Jumbo was tossed into deep water. But as he flailed, he slowly began to notice how his trunk helped him float, and how moving his legs created motion. He was swimming! In that moment, Jumbo realized—he didn’t need anyone else’s help. He wasn’t lazy, he just needed to learn his own way. Jumbo swam far from the forest, leaving behind the mocking voices and painful memories. He found peace, purpose, and freedom—finally living happily ever after. </p><p>🐘 Moral of the Story: Never let others define your pace. You may just need your own rhythm to shine. 🌊
