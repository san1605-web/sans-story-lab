<p>
Elvina who was a sweet little princess of the kingdom Kenna was not really that sweet who can tell the difference in her smile no one knows if it's a smirk or sweet smile. It's really sweet smile in the beginning but somehow ended up being the honey poisoned glazed smirk.</p><p>


She was always a sweet princess but trapped in a cage where she has to be the slave for the fate and follow the orders of an unknown voice.</p><p>


Unknown voice was the ultimate control over Elvina she can't tell what she really thinks as not even be the way she really wants which was the reason for darkness. She need to be the queen but before that she really wanna escape from that unknown voice.</p>


<p>This unknown voice has a stop moment once in a while when Elvina can be herself and unknown voice can't catch her so she utilises that time to get ready for escape carefully planning everything for the day when she can finally leave. The time when she let go of that heavy gowns loaded with all fake and flowy hairstyle with flower crown which was like thorns in head and those metal slippers which she couldn't lift without the maximum strength and everything will change.
</p><p>

On someday Elvina got caught and unknown voice went into rage and ordered to kill Elvina without even listening to her.</p><p>


She then vowed she will take her throne of freedom and be the queen of Kenna and somehow escaped she went into exile.</p><p>


She began to learn about the unknown voice which was actually a grumpy old woman who was being there and controlling the Kenna for years due to her longing for power.
</p><p>

Kenna knows the kindest version of me and it got me nothing those people all want my power and respects the power right I'll reclaim it and show the darker version to understand me better the way I'm the power not the position I held not the freaking voice lady.</p><p>

</p>
<p>
Elvina trained hard in dark whenever she felt demotivated she will remember how she got people treat her in past and then she awakens darkness where she hates the whole world except her and she doesn't really know the reason for hating sometimes and sometimes whenever she thinks of forgiving she reminds all the past where she can't have her own voice and not even thoughts she had to be a puppet who will not and agree to all the things they said.
</p><p>

The moment when she stepped out the heavy gowns she was in armour protecting her at all costs and thorn crown was taken so she had a helmet to shield her head and those heavy boots were replaced by simple leather boots and those hands which were always obeyed and treated everyone with care are now holding a sword and those eyes which were always kind to everyone and with deep grief inside are now like fire lamps and thoughts which were full of just wanting to live independently by escape are now full of revenge for not letting her live what she wants to be like she finally understand as long as she chooses to run theres no place where she can be like herself she decided to fight not to run.</p>


<p>Moment she was been waiting finally arrived she got herself ready and went into Kenna she decided to find the box at the non-functional hour of UT and destroy it. She sneaked into palace and made her self look like some lowly commoner and there she saw another woman obeying the commands and she smiled it's not a smile it's a smirk. She waited for the non functional hour and then she finally arrived at the box but it was really a tough scene to cross all the paths to get the box she will be in need of someone to cover then she created her identical and made it her cover and started crossing.
</p><p>

She went deeper and found the box was an illusion and it's not there she was so mad and then it's high time the non functional hour will be end soon so she left quick.</p>

<p>
In mad she went away to her base thinking and letting all her thoughts wander to get the answer she travelled a lot to find the answer she finally got the past.</p><p>


She finally got to know it wasnt actually a box with a mad old woman voice to control it's rather a book which has people write what they want and make someone obey. And the reason behind this is in the past in Kenna people were under control of royals some of them are nice and some of them are devilish that's why they created a book where they can write their own destinies using anyone as puppets in their story and make them obey what they said and many of the people used to hate Elvina and feared if she was let to go independent she will rule Kenna where they had to be in control.</p><p>


So they want me to beg by manipulating me and moreover they even feared me at the lowest. Ha ha ha so it's time get them in discipline and show the greatest no no darkest version of me and let them see how it feels to be in control.
</p><p>

---</p><p>


I'll get ready to say hi to my dear people and how can I go there without present let's take a few poisons no it wouldn't be that good let's take puppets they love puppeting so much right I'll make some and gift them to them.</p><p>


She captured a few people who were involved in her story writing. She took them to a dark place and started laughing and said hi dears do you remember me.
</p><p>

They were trembled in fear and started begging to let them go she said I'll let you go but in my terms hey you you are the one who made me wear those heavy gowns right so you love to see me in gowns and you thought if I wear something else I'll be independent and rule you. Ha some how I love your idea. Let's see how would you look like in that here you go ahead made that person wear a heavy 100 layered gown filled with blood and drenched in water to make it more heavy it was like a art piece to see but it was damn heavy that person can't even breathe.</p><p>


Next upon let's see the crown and boot manufacturer at once oh you were the one right how can I forget your masterpieces here you go. She gifted him a real nail throne and those heavy boots and upon hearing that they said you can't do this our new queen will be here soon.</p><p>


Soon as they said their queen arrived and started to urge for them at beginning soon at Elvina hand giving handshake saying well done Elvina glad to meet you again hey could you please get this part go fast I'm no longer willing to bear this heavy gown I'll kill that guy if I had seen him Elvina smiled and showed here you go pointing at her walking masterpiece.</p><p>


They both laughed together after a while they still have someone who didn't get punishment yet for teaching etiquette. They approached her and said hello together in a eerie tone so you are the one who let us bullied by others and not even given a chance to retaliate and you described our talents and forced us into chores right. Elvina paused and asked my dear sweety oh no now you are the queen I'm afraid lol. Queen laughed and said hey I'm down being the queen take this bloody crown and punish them as you like. Elvina asked I think you had some past traumas with this etiquette teacher ill let her be yours you can declare.
</p><p>

They together punished all and now back to kingdom to teach etiquette and manners to all people. They smiled and returned to kingdom.</p>

<p>This is not the ending of elvina and kenna it's the beginning let's see how our dark queen bring life into the world of puppets...
