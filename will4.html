    ##

<p>Willy received Vol 3 from Steeve. She understood her role—to step into the story once more, to create a wonder, and through it, reunite with her family.
</p>


<p>When she awoke inside the book, she sensed the character she now inhabited: **Senna**.</p>



<p>Senna was born into a well-off family of business. Outwardly, she was admired as a fashion icon, but inwardly, she carried a dream no one allowed her to touch—**to make her career in fashion, to live free and independent**. Her parents, however, had different plans. At first, they forced her to study business. Later, they demanded she learn household chores to prepare for marriage. But marriage was the last thing Senna wanted.</p>



<p>One day, an argument erupted. Her parents insisted she pursue business immediately. But Senna, guided by Willy’s resolve, stood her ground.</p>

<p>“I’ll learn business,” she said firmly, “and I’ll even run the company for a time. But when I decide to leave, I will. You cannot force me to live a life I don’t want. My style, my choices, my freedom—you won’t take those from me. And don’t ever bring marriage to me again. It isn’t my dream.”</p>



<p>Her rage shocked them. They had never seen such fire in her eyes. Fearing to lose her altogether, they reluctantly agreed to her terms. But Senna knew their silence was fragile. So she entered business school—and at the same time, secretly pursued fashion.</p>



<p>By day she studied ledgers and strategies. By night she sketched designs, learned fabrics, and stitched her own creations. She knew the cost of chasing both dreams, but she would not kneel.
</p>


<p>Then came an opportunity: a fashion competition. It was her chance to show her work to the world. But just before she could submit, disaster struck—her designs vanished. They had been **deleted by her brother**. When she protested, her parents mocked her instead of defending her.</p>



<p>Shaken but not broken, Senna rushed to remake her designs. Sleepless, frantic, she sketched until her fingers ached, finally sending in a fresh set just before the deadline.</p>



<p>But when the results came, **Aeris**, a renowned designer, summoned her and another contestant—her friend, Nyx. To Senna’s shock, Nyx had submitted **her stolen designs**.
</p>


<p>“Senna,” Aeris thundered, “how dare you copy Nyx’s work?”</p>



<p>Nyx smirked, but Senna did not crumble. “These are mine,” she said calmly. “I can prove it.”</p>



<p>When asked to explain, Nyx stuttered and faltered. Aeris’s sharp eyes began to see through the lie. Then Senna revealed her proof: the hidden details in her sketches—tiny symbols, unique strokes, and her personal marks, impossible to copy.
</p>


<p>Nyx’s silence was the final verdict. She stood frozen, her lies dissolved.
</p>


<p>Aeris, moved by Senna’s courage and talent, chose her as a **student**, guiding her deeper into the art of fashion. At home, her parents no longer forced her; they realized she carried a strength they could not bend.
</p>


<p>Years passed. Senna completed both her business studies and her fashion training. She returned to the family company, leading with brilliance. Doubtful employees whispered against her, but she silenced them with one bold project and even fired those who refused to accept her.</p>



<p>Once the company was stable, she approached her father.</p>

<p>“I’ve done my part. Now, I want to leave and start my own business—something truly mine.”</p>



<p>Her father, once strict, now softened. “I understand. But for a little longer, I need your guidance.”</p>

<p>Senna agreed—for a time.
</p>


<p>When she finally launched her dream, it bore a name that echoed her identity: **SEN**. Named after herself, it stood as her declaration of freedom and independence.</p>



<p>Senna built her team of **ten master artisans** and introduced an innovation that transformed fashion itself: an app where customers could design their dream clothes. They could choose fabrics, patterns, and accessories, see the price and due dates, and order directly—no need to move from shop to shop. Senna gave them what she had once longed for herself: **choice, clarity, and freedom**.</p>



<p>This was her wonder.</p>



<p>Willy, inside Senna’s skin, felt it deeply. Her own dream had always been fashion—and through Senna, she lived that success.</p>



<p>When the book released her, Willy awoke with tears. Clara, Sean, and Steeve rushed to her side, panicked.</p>

<p>“What happened?” they asked.</p>



<p>Willy smiled through her tears. “I did it. I created a wonder.”

<p>Then she laughed softly. “No… I am the wonder.”</p>



<p>The four embraced, joy overflowing. Together, Clara, Sean, Steeve, and Willy sat around the table, sharing food Steeve had made, teasing and laughing as if no sorrow had ever touched them.</p>



<p>At last, the family was whole. The pages of their stories had closed, but the wonder they had become would live forever.</p>
