    <h1>Will You Be the Wonder</h1>
    <div class="chapter">Vol 3 — Steeve</div>

    <p>
      Steeve blinked. The parchment of the storybook faded, and when he opened his eyes, he was no longer just Father Steeve. He was Sam.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sam, the man who once dazzled the kitchen with his culinary magic. A chef who could take the simplest ingredients—an onion, a pinch of salt, a dash of memory—and weave them into something unforgettable. But time, as it often does, had dulled his fire. Praises had turned into demands, joy had been swallowed by routine, and the applause of diners had quieted into silence.



    </p>

    <p>
      He stopped cooking—not because he couldn’t, but because he believed no one cared anymore.


    </p>

    <p>
      But Volume 3 would not allow him to remain unseen.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the story his children, Sean and Clara, had unlocked for him. They had stepped into the real world, leaving behind trails of wonder. Now, it was his turn. 
    </p>

    <p>
      
      Steeve—as Sam—felt the weight of that question echoing once again:


    </p>

    <p>
      *"Will you be the wonder?"*
    </p>

    <p>
      The story wasn’t asking him to save kingdoms or conquer villains. It was asking him to rediscover the passion he had buried. To pick up the knife, the ladle, the flame, and create again. To remind the world—and himself—that forgotten wonders can still rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      For in this volume, the kitchen was his battlefield, the stove his altar, and every dish he made a story waiting to be told.


    </p>

    <p>
      ### **Chapter Two – Smoke and Sugar**


    </p>

    <p>
     Sam didn’t rush to the kitchen.
    </p>

    <p>
      That would’ve been too predictable
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, he strolled into a quiet café near campus, sketchbook under his arm. His classmates thought he was wasting time—playing cool as always.


    </p>

    <p>
     But Steeve, deep inside him, was busy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pencil moved swiftly, sketching plates, ideas, flavors—visions for dishes that had never existed before.
    </p>

    <p>
      One page bloomed into a vision: **a flower resting on a still pond.**


    </p>

    <p>
      Beautiful enough to trick the eyes into thinking it was dessert, but when tasted, fire struck—layers of spice hidden in sweetness.


    </p>

    <p>
      The next sketch came darker: **a forest set ablaze.**


    </p>

    <p>
      A plate where curls of smoky mist rose, scarlet streaks spreading like wildfire. Sweetness hid beneath chaos, a paradox on the tongue.


    </p>
<p>Sam smirked as he shaded the last curl of smoke.

</p>
    <p>
      Sweet and spicy. Fire and water. Deception and honesty.
    </p>
<p>This was more than cooking. This was a statement.

</p>
    <p>
      ### **Chapter Three – Flames Behind Closed Doors**


    </p>

    <p>
      The marketplace buzzed as Sam filled his basket: crimson peppers, emerald greens, soft lilac cabbages, bright orange roots. Each was more than food—it was paint for his canvas.
    </p>
    <p>He paused at an old lady’s street stall—the woman he had once defended in a fight years ago. She smiled, surprise in her eyes.

</p>
    <p>
“I need to cook somewhere quiet,” he said.</p>
<p>Her smile widened. “My kitchen. You know the stove.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, granny.”</p>



<p>Inside, the kitchen smelled of herbs and wood smoke. Flames danced, knives sang, spices hissed. Sam was no longer invisible; he was an artist reclaiming his stage.</p>



<p>Outside, his so-called friends came searching.
</p>
<p>“Seen Sam?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he went to play out,” she replied.</p>

<p>They left, snickering.</p>



<p>But Sam whispered, “Thanks.”</p>

<p>The old woman froze—he had changed. Fierce, grateful, unstoppable.</p>



---



<p>### **Chapter Four – The Colors of Fire**</p>



<p>Sam chopped, boiled, and pureed. Beets gave him pink and red petals. But blue eluded him.</p>



<p>“Blueberries?” he frowned.</p>
</p>
<p>“Paste them with chili,” the old woman said, smiling. “Make blue water. Spicy enough to sting. Colorful enough to trick the eyes.”</p>



<p>Soon, the pot bubbled with indigo liquid, steam curling like smoke from a battlefield. Sweetness and spice collided on the tongue, and Sam laughed, fire sparking in his gaze.</p>



<p>“This… is art,” he whispered.</p>



---



<p>### **Chapter Five – Dishes of Deception**</p>



<p>Sam layered petals of beet across a shimmering glaze. The flower on the pond looked like a dessert but hid fire inside.</p>



<p>Then, the smoky blueberry-chili sauce formed the base for the *Forest on Fire*, chocolate soil, caramelized sugar trees, and smoke rising like embers. Sweet, cool dessert hid beneath chaos.</p>



<p>With the last vegetables, he added tiny accents—green spirals, orange curls, delicate garnishes.</p>



<p>Finally, he placed both creations on one plate.</p>

<p>“**Fiter**,” he said. “Fire and water. Complete. Course meal and dessert.”</p>



<p>The old woman nodded quietly. She had seen a storm reborn.</p>



---



<p>### **Chapter Six – The Stage of Fire**</p>



<p>Days of practice, whispers, and rivalries led to the competition hall. Competitors rushed, knives clattered, flames roared.</p>



<p>Sam walked in calm, basket in hand, sketchbook tucked away. His friends sneered.</p>

<p>“See? He’s choking again.”</p>



<p>He ignored them, eyes on the judges and the flames of his stove.
</p>
<p>The announcer boomed:</p>

<p>“Welcome to the Rising Star Competition! Today, these young chefs will battle with vision!”</p>



<p>The bell rang. Sam stepped into the battlefield of his destiny.
</p>


---



<p>### **Chapter Seven – Fiter**</p>



<p>He stood for a moment, letting the chaos wash over him, then began.</p>



<p>The flower bloomed, spice hidden beneath sweetness.
</p>
<p>The forest smoked, chocolate soil grounding caramelized sugar trees, blueberries and chili whispering chaos and calm.
</p>


<p>With leftover vegetables, he added tiny details—final strokes on his masterpiece.
</p>


<p>He named the plate **Fiter**:</p>

<p>*“Fi for fire. Ter for water. Together—a balance. A course meal and dessert.”*</p>



<p>Judges whispered, confused, intrigued.</p>

<p>Sam stepped back. “Taste the wonder.”</p>



---



<p>### **Chapter Eight – The Hidden Truth on a Plate**</p>



<p>The final bell rang. Silence filled the hall.</p>



<p>“Explain your creation,” the judge asked.</p>



<p>Sam pointed to the flower:</p>

<p>“Peaceful water showing full confidence—but spice strikes inside. Tension beneath calm. Playing cool doesn’t mean we aren’t fighting battles.”

</p>

<p>He turned to the forest:</p>

<p>“Looks messy, but it’s dessert. Sweet and cool inside, reminding us life can be messy yet comforting. I made this dish because I suffered from low self-esteem. We don’t need to show our actual side all the time to win—but hiding too much is harmful.”</p>



<p>Silence fell. Even his mockers had nothing to say.</p>

<p>“Let’s taste the wonder,” whispered the head judge.</p>



---



<p>### **Chapter Nine – Tears of Fire and Water**</p>



<p>The audience erupted—claps, some crying, all moved. Judges tasted. Spice struck, sweetness melted, chaos turned into harmony.</p>



<p>Finally, the announcement:</p>

<em>**“The Rising Star is… Sam.”**</em>



<p>Sam broke down. Tears rolled freely, joy bursting through years of fear and doubt.</p>



<p>One judge, a renowned chef, walked forward.</p>

<p>“Fiter will be on my restaurant’s special menu. And Sam… if you’re willing, join me in my kitchen.”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Sam whispered through tears.</p>



<p>Father Steeve smiled. Sam had become a wonder.</p>



---



<p>### **Final Chapter – The Wonder at Home**</p>



<p>Sam walked into the city, part-time chef, part-time student, unshakable. He had reclaimed his confidence and his dream.</p>



<p>Steeve, deep inside, smiled. Yes, he had also learned cooking along the way. 😂</p>



<p>One morning, Volume 3 rested in his wife’s hands. Sam hummed, jumped, and began making *Fiter* in his own kitchen. Sean and Clara awoke to the melody, following him to the kitchen.</p>



<p>“Come on,” he said, smiling. “Let’s make Fiter together.”</p>



<p>And so, father and children worked side by side. Laughter, smoke, and flavors filled the air. The battlefield was gone; only warmth and wonder remained.</p>



<p>Here, Steeve wasn’t a character, nor a contender.</p>

<p>He was a father, a dreamer, a cook—sharing his wonder with those he loved most.</p>



<p>And that, perhaps, was the truest wonder of 

all.</p>
