<h3>Elvina :Return to kenna</h3>
 <p>Elvina and new queen arrived at kenna .Upon arriving at kenna they thought all these people are really disgusting .what they know is how to judge and control others. Let's change these people's rotten brains. They arrived at the palace. It was as same as before huge, colourful and with a lot of rush due to maids and people running here and there ...</p>

<p>But onething seems to change there's no more voice to control elvina and new queen.They decided to write the destinies, but in a different way. </p><p>Elvina asked new queen ,<em>"oh my queen" !</em><i>would you like take your teaching passion again?</i> with  a smirk in a  teasing tone.</p>



<p>Queen smiled like she got something and answered <em><i>"ugh!I have been waiting for that  sure my sweet student ".</i></em></p><p><i>They stayed up late planning everything to go well and at end of the day before saying good night </i></p>

<p>Elvina said <i><em>"oh my mighty highness !"</em></i></p>

<p>Queen said <em>"stop it elvina! just call me leona or teacher itself don't play with me. I'll definitely throw a punch if you tease me again, I can't guarantee your safety ".</em></p>

<i>Actually, leona is a great teacher she was the one who saved elvina when the voice ordered to kill her .she rescued elvina nd trained her 

after training elvina asked for help and she agreed to be puppet in her place in the palace as a new queen for few days when she was in exile .

Leona played new queen. And whenever the voice stop moment comes she secretly left palace to teach elvina.</i>

<p>Next day leona went to court and said<em>" oh my dear people from today onwards we have a new queen"</em> and introduced elvina  People were in shock as they were sure about death of elvina.  Elvina smirks and  says <em>"today onwards I'll rule and show you guys the correct way to use those ."</em>

 <em>"I'll show you how to use those books of destinies well". </em></p>

<p><i>I almost forgot to introduce and I hope you all know her well your new teacher or should I introduce as <em>"queen" </em> both leona nad elvina laughed loud and  elvina started saying leona ,she is leona call her mam give her respect as me if I know someone has disrespected her,

 I'll take your head and one more thing tomorrow onwards you need to send your children to schools. I'll be in charge of all schools while leona will be there all time in inspection if I didn't find some child over there at school, I'll be at your door step!. I think you all got me!! am i clear ?</i></p><p>!she shouted !</p>

<p>Then coming to elders ,you ll get a set of rules by tomorrow to follow if someone violates I'll personally take care of them .</p>

<p>That's it for today !</p>

<p>Elvian and leona headed back to the palace while people were in chaos and literally a rage some of them were trying to attack elvina luckily she got them and dodged all the attacks and assigned punishments as well </p>
<p>
Upon seeing the punishments intensity no one dared to confront elvina and left with silent rage in heart and terrific expression on face .Leona and elvina started planning for the next day school they prepared everything a head as they want those children to be different from their parents who were trampling with those books for everything they want </p>

<p>Leona and elvina together designed all kind arts and placed them in the school letting every child try what they want and then they supervised those works and decided to choose one for children ask for their opinion to make it as their Career</p> 

<p>that night going through those parts even the darkest heart of elvina started melting when see saw their little drawings of her and leona and those words of joy and excitement for the school she even teased leona by saying <em>"see here they have drawn me better than you so they admire me than you grumpy old teacher 😂" .</em>leona brushed it off by saying <em>"that's all because you spoil them well by handing them sweets and chocolates even scolding their parents for hurting them or making them to do anything they dont want unlike me who actually presses them to do better in their chosen careers and be the best for themselves" .</em></p>

<p>Next day leona set classrooms and things and started working on their talents and giving them feedback elvina arrived a while later and started to check all the corridors and students she started to check the attendance and then while she was roaming in corridor she find some students out of classrooms she went and asked<em> oh sweety! why are you here ? </em>That lil guy replied <em>queen el ,mam gave us a punishment as we're not paying attention in the class actually we were chatting as we're really hungry as we didn't have much time in the morning to eat.</em></p>

<p>Elvina softened  and went in to the classroom leona greeted elvina .elvina smiled and said <em>teacher can't you let go of our Lil ones this time ? </em></p>

<p><em>Oh so you are here to plead for them ha</em> leona grinned</p>

<p>Elvina Smiled cutely and said <em>could you please ...</em></p>

<p>Leona said <em>so your queen wants me to let you guys go so I'll let her take punishment instead</em></p>

<p>Children shouted saying <em>no don't hurt her. we will take the punishment we are the ones, who did wrong. so it's good to be responsible. please don't hurt our queen el mam .</em>Elvina smiled with a sense of accomplishment and asked leona for a leave and told her<em> I'll be back in 10 mins assemble these lil guys they were hungry that why they are chatting with eachother about lunch we will take them to royal kitchen and I'll let these guys to make some dishes if they love to do so</em></p>



<p>Leona sighed <em> you are such a pain, i had to keep you away from school</em> leave for now</p>and let go of elvina </p><p> elvina winked at children and left to kitchen to make preparations for their lil adventure of cooking</p>

<p>Elvina summoned chefs and asked them about protocols of kitchen ,and ordered a whole set of meals for children and treats she asked them to make it easier for children to try </p>

<p>Meanwhile leona completed lessons real quick and started getting them assembled saying <em>oh your queen is a real mess .she just gets all things messed up.</em> children laughed out loud with one glare from leona they stopped laughing .</p><p>Elvina made all the preps and came back with apron on her to school and asked leona to wear one leona said <em>childish .I'll wear one when I get there take them and we will walk to palace did you get the things ready ?</em></p>

<p>Elvina said <em>mam I did pls shower your questions slowly this dumb person cant answer all of them at once </em></p>

<p>Leona said <em>for real</em></p> 

<p>Elvina took children to palace they all started with making dough for cookies and then some where with elvina playing with dough literally making a mess as they dont know how to make something out of it elvina and children altogether were covered with flour and they were mischievous saying <em>hey throw that dough ball at me. 
</em></p><p><em>
I'll hit it </em></p><p>Leona on watching that messy scene, she was a bit too annoyed. but a bit happy to see elvina like that she remembered elvina saying her childhood was a complete mess .she can't try all fun things .she smiled at her standing the door and then shouted at them to stand still. she ll teach them what to do Leona went there and taught them one by one they started learning them for the first for themselves not for the others or doing chores children were really happy some of their dishes were tasted by elvina and she even sent a few to their homes saying your child's cooking enjoy it but dont ask for  them to do it </p>

<p>Days were passing smoothly seeing elvina sweet and smooth  in the long run people  forget her warnings </p>

<p>When she arrived at school ,one day she noticed there were a few students missing .she thought ,they were sick she let it go and the whole week kept like that there was huge change in attendance it seems to be down and some people were trying snatch those destiny books from elvina .</p>

<p>Elvina got the point .she went straight children's home and noticed they were doing chores and things they weren't interested and forced .she was really mad .she dragged one of the parents and asked what was they doing there? and she was about to drew her sword but then she heard child cry saying <em>no queen el please let them go </em></p>

<p>Parents were terrified with that look of elvina with a sword in her hand. child plead made her with drew the sword but she still warned them it won't be that easy this time.</p><p><i> I'll take you away like before I think you all remember those guys who were punished at the beginning and you all know my masterpiece .I'll take you away to get those punishments from children ,if you made them work hard it's their right to live what they want to be like don't get on my nerves </i>and left </p>

<p>She went back to palace discussing the whole scenario with leona saying <em>there's still some rotten minds. I'm getting angry .i could have killed them all at that moment. but all I want is to change them, why can't they get it. today onwards we were changing every thing. I'm not supposed to use those books at first but  things got like this .I'll use them and make them regret their doings do you know, leona when I saw that child doing something they don't wanna do .my past flashes before and urges me to free them </em></p>

<p>Leona soother elvina and said <em>if you also do so there's nothing in difference between you and then let's think of something else</em><p> they poured their brains all night </p><p> in the morning elvina come running to leona saying <em>how about we deliberately made easy to get those books? and then catch those and punish them.</em></p> 

<p> Leona can't get hold of elvina as she was really in such a rage so she agreed.</p> <p> they started making the trap and deliberately let the news out as expected thieves came and tried</p><p> some of them were caught then elvina came forward saying <em>I'll kill you here but it won't be a lesson for all them. so you will be in charge of those books. if a book missed, I'll dig your heart out. and write your destiny with that blood </em></p>

<p>Leona was worried about elvina getting mad and end up killing someone for real so she took her away to a room</p>  <p> next day elvina wasn't in the court instead leona was there saying <em>elvina was in rest for a few days and I'll be in charge. here are the rules. you should mind your own business .no one can interfere with one another and next children were supposed to do what they want .if not, as elvina said this time I'll come to take your head. you all know I'm not as elvina who is kind to children and softened on hearing their laughter </em></p>

<p>While elvina is in rest ,leona take all responsibility of school as she said if a child wasn't there she went to their home and bring back whether it is by a talk, or by hitting she don't care all she wants is elvina's dream come true </p>

<p>Days passed elvina didn't showed children were worried and dared to ask leona</p> 

<p>They asked<em> ma ma ..m mm mammm...  Where's queen el ?why Didn't she showed up ?</em></p>

 <p><em>So you all decided talk to me for your queen ha .you little fellows you guys even gave her a nickname el and she accepted it. I don't know why she is softened by you fellows .so you weren't terrified by her .she thought you guys were terrified by her appearance that day with the sword .so she didn't come here and she was really sick you wanna see her</em></p>



<p>She agreed and took them to elvina </p>.<p>elvina was weak from sickness even though she gathered all strength and played with them as they left she smiled and said<em> leona thank you so much this is what I want their pure hearts can't get polluted by those rotten ones. I'll be back in two days with full energy </em>and fainted there leona rushed to cure her and realised she was seriously ill this time and someone is using that bloody book again .</p>

<p>Leona takes charge of books and got to know that the last time elvina risked her book to catch thieves and some of them were doing this. she caught those guards at point of her sword and commanded to get that book they all left for few days school was closed children were a bit worried about leona and elvina </p><p> while leona was in hunt for book ,someone attacked elvina she tried to dodge but no use she was injured severely leona rushed on knowing that and some how tried her best to make her live, but it was already to late </p><p>.but elvina was on verge of death she was smiling and saying<em> leona I was glad that I met you take care of the kingdom</em ><p>leona scolded and said <em>you would be ok and in few mins children were coming here hang on .don't say anything stupid</em></p><p> elvina smiled </p><p>she was about to go to sleep heard children's laughter she tried to be awake.</p><p>on seeing their sweet queen el like that they all started crying elvina tried to persuade them to stop crying</p> leona can't say anything on hearing children crying parents arrived and saw their children were crying really bad for elvina and her care for her </p><p>one of the child stood up and said you guys were really bad when did queen el hurt us? when did have hurt you guys ?she was always been  good to us .she was always been there for us. why did you do so? when someone from other countries came and tried to got all those books ,you were fighting for. she fought for you all and then she even got injured making her health go too bad .but what you guys did is attacking her listen, I'm saying on behalf of all children we weren't going home with you guys .you can leave if you don't the soldier trainees in us will come out to get you out and I can't guarantee your safety. we were all trained to cold but we showed the warmth as we know queen el don't want us to be so cold to everyone .</p>

<p>But if someone gets to this point of hurting her, we need to stand up for ourselves and our protector</p>

 <p>And also return the book of queen el to us. why can't you understand her. she wants us to live for ourselves. she never intended to make us tremble in fear or rule over us. but she pitied us for the foolishness of using books to control and she was been in research to destroy those  .she was been traveling and  searching for the solution .now that I saw your gift for her .we decided this time we support queen el if she drew her sword we won't stop.</p> 

<p>Now try again leona stood there smiling and crying at the same time it was the first time she shed tears in her lifetime for someone else. elvina ws happy and when she heard those words of children she was happy and gathered all her strength and said<em> leona this is what I said I ve made a generation which can justify the situation without any attachment .they were always be the honest and the law abode citizens .they ll take care of kenna and then she said I'm warning you all this is not my end I'll come again even I was a ghost. I'll protect these pure hearts</em> and she died .children's cries filled the halls leona cried so hard some of the citizens got to know their mistakes and regretted it as the child said no child went back to their house </p>

<p>Few years passed ...</p>

<p>Children were learning well now they are teens and now they began teaching younger generations </p>

<p>One certain day someone manipulated all into getting the books and using them leona was away and children tried their best to stop they were severely hurt .At that moment hearing their cries ,elvina dark soul awakened , came back on seeing her children were happy. but she was no longer the same as before she was so cold this time. she went on rampage and got all those thieves  were caught and she burnt all books and made them drink those ashes and choke to death on seeing her in that form and with that anger children were petrified they can't dare to step a head and speak to her .</p>

<p>Leona returned and saw elvina she immediately went to elvina and hugged her but elvina shrugged her off and said<em> leona what was happening here why are they hurt ? Leave it today I'll make sure they ll see the hell for hurting these .I said I'll be back and here these lil guys are in total chaos </em></p>

<p>She was fuming leona tried to calm her saying<em> children were terrified to speak .</em>but this time she didn't listened .she went to every one and she manipulated them by using her magic if it doesn't work she killed them .seeing her rage children dared to step front and speak to her to calm down and see the brighter side </p>

<p>They all tried to remember those kitchen school moments and even baked some snacks for her seeing their innocence ,she was calmed finally she took them and left to palace. children followed she saw the palace was full of paintings of her and children and they even prayed for her whole years and kept her room clean and placed gifts for her hoping for her return.</p>

<p>On seeing them the dark soul brightened and elvina said lil guys I'll be always here with you .I took a break before .now I came back we will together fight for us .thank you for your lovely gifts they were happy leona said <em>oh there's no thanks for me who managed all these naughty kids and haughty persons in the kingdom now you got kids to play. you forgot me </em></p>

<p>Elvina smiled and said <em>how is that possible my sweet teacher ,I know you can take care that's why I left without worrying now that I'm back let's fight together .</em>they all happily chatted at the table and at the end, they all fighters every fight united and never again about those books or anything  leona and elvina went  on tours with those children and their kingdom was the happiest and peaceful.this is the story of elvina ...</p>

<p>Trying to find herself found a whole new world from that journey...</p>
