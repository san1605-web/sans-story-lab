<p>
### **Vol.5 – Fam Clash**</p>



<p>
When they were peacefully eating fiter and enjoying their chatting, Sean suddenly spoke:</p>

<p>
“We did finish four parts… what about five? What will happen?”</p>



<p>
The whole family grew curious. Together, they searched and started reading.</p>




<p>
Then, once again, a whisper filled the air:</p>



<p>
**“Well done. You all did a great job in the previous. Now it’s time for you to be together in a time travel… to Elena Kingdom. Survive using your characters’ powers.”**
</p>


<p>
And just like that, Clara became Dia — fire within.</p>

<p>
Sean remained Sean — peaceful yet stormy water.</p>

<p>
Steeve became Sam — smooth like air, hiding a tornado.</p>

<p>
Willy became Senna — earth-like patience, with the wisdom of sowing and reaping.</p>



<p>
Together, they were no longer just a family.</p>

<p>
They were **a family of wonders.**</p>



---


<p>

#### Surviving in Elena</p>



<p>
Their first task was simple: to survive. They needed jobs. Guided by Sean’s historical sense, they explored the markets and busy streets, observing culture and ways of living. By nightfall, they found a cave to rest in and discussed plans.</p>



<p>
* Dia, the youngest, would enter school and shine as a scholar with her modern knowledge.</p>

*<p>
 Sean would become a teacher, blending history with fresh ideas.
</p>
<p>
* Steeve, with his cooking skills, would aim for the imperial kitchen.
</p>
<p>
* Willy would use her fashion sense to capture the empress’s attention and build her foothold.</p>



<p>
The next day, they worked odd jobs to earn food.</p>

<p>
#### Dia’s First Step
</p>


<p>
While walking the streets, Dia noticed a math competition. She stepped forward, solved it brilliantly, and impressed a teacher who immediately offered to take her in as a student. She agreed — her journey had begun.</p>



<p>
Sean, meanwhile, not only took up teaching but also introduced English to help the people communicate with outsiders, winning respect.</p>



<p>
Steeve and Willy earned some coins from odd work, though they couldn’t yet reach the palace gates. Still, they were happy to see Dia and Sean succeeding.
</p>

<p>
#### Sam’s Cooking Duel</p>



<p>
The turning point came when Sam (Steeve) deliberately teased a chef, sparking a heated argument. A crowd gathered, and soon a cooking duel was declared.</p>



<p>
The chef made mooncakes.</p>



<p>
But Sam shocked everyone with his strange creation — a dessert that looked like spicy curry, yet melted sweetly in the mouth. The crowd roared. Sam won.</p>



<p>
He received a huge prize, enough to open a small stall and even buy a house for the family.
</p>


<p>
That night, as they ate together, Sean suggested pooling money to invest in Senna’s dream: fabric and fashion. Everyone agreed.</p>



---



<p>
#### Senna’s Invention
</p>


<p>
The next morning, Senna visited a cloth shop. She bought plain white fabric — colored ones were too costly — along with threads and needles. She then climbed the mountains to gather fruits and flowers, which she used to dye fabrics naturally.</p>



<p>
Days passed. Slowly, she built a small collection of beautifully dyed fabrics. At night, the family joined her in stitching. In the mornings, they returned to their jobs.</p>



<p>
Soon, they decided to attempt something greater — building a sewing machine. It was rough, but slowly coming to life.</p>



<p>
When a festival approached, the family wore Senna’s handmade modern-style clothing. As they entered, nobles turned their heads, mesmerized. The family became the center of whispers and admiration.</p>



<p>
The very next day, they received summons from nobles requesting those designs.</p>



---



<p>
#### Winning the Palace</p>



<p>
Senna completed her first orders, which soon reached the empress herself.</p>



<p>
The empress summoned Senna and asked for a **stunning gown** for a royal party, followed by the traditional **family union banquet.** Senna poured her heart into the designs, crafting elegance never before seen.</p>



<p>
At the banquet, the empress stole the spotlight. The emperor himself noticed and commissioned matching outfits.
</p>


<p>
Senna even planned the banquet’s entire theme. It was a **grand success.**</p>



<p>
She was rewarded not only with wealth but with a **fabric and cloth shop of her own.** By then, the sewing machines were ready, and her business bloomed.
</p>

<p>
#### The Family of Wonders</p>



<p>
Thus, the bookworm family became renowned in Elena as the **Family of Wonders.**
</p>


<p>
At last, the book’s magic carried them back to modern times. They were rewarded with their characters’ abilities, a library full of books, and priceless experiences.</p>



<p>
Together, they used their gifts to strengthen their real lives, supporting each other as always.</p>



<p>
Because in the end, they weren’t just dreamers.</p>

<p>
They were — and always will be — **a wonder.**</p>
